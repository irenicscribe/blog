> Therefore, whoever nullifies one of the **least of these commandments**, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 5:19)

In the New Testament, the spiritual law and the letter of the law refer to different aspects of the law. The letter of the law refers to the literal interpretation and enforcement of the law, whereas the spiritual law refers to the underlying principles or spirit of the law. The letter of the law is concerned with external obedience, while the spiritual law is concerned with the inner attitudes and motives that drive our actions.

For example, Jesus often criticized the Pharisees for their strict adherence to the letter of the law while ignoring its spiritual intent. He taught that following the spirit of the law was more important than adhering to its letter. In Matthew 5:20, he says, "For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." This means that simply following the letter of the law is not enough to enter the kingdom of heaven. We must also follow the spiritual intent of the law and have the right attitudes and motives.

The "least of these commandments" could be referring to what Jesus says in the following verses starting at verse 21:

> You have heard that the ancients were told, ‘YOU SHALL NOT MURDER,’ and ‘Whoever commits murder shall be answerable to the court.’ But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be answerable to the court; and whoever says to his brother, ‘You good-for-nothing,’ shall be answerable to the supreme court; and whoever says, ‘You fool,’ shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell. (Matthew 5:21-22)

The Jews were strict with following the letter of the law. In this case the actual act of murdering. However, the idea that being angry with your brother was as bad as murder was not on their radar. This would (in their eyes) be considered the less important commandment compared to murder as we know it. The same principle applies to the remaining commandments of Jesus in this chapter (verses 27, 31, 33, 38, 43). Some would argue that the "least of these commandments" refers to the ceremonial aspects of the law, but I'm not sure how this can be the case when we are no longer help captive to the law (Galatians 3:23–25). Paul goes as far as to tell Gentiles not to be circumcised (Galatians 5:2), which was a commandment under the old covenant (Genesis 17:10–14).
