> Where there is no guidance the people fall, But in an abundance of counselors there is victory. (Proverbs 11:14)

While the proverb in question does emphasize seeking advice from many advisers, which might appear similar to an appeal to popularity (ad populum) fallacy, it's important to consider the broader context and intent of the proverb within its cultural and literary framework.

The proverb is not suggesting that seeking advice from many advisers is right simply because it's a popular opinion. Rather, it's highlighting the practical wisdom of seeking counsel from a diverse group of knowledgeable individuals to make more informed decisions. The emphasis is on the quality and diversity of the advice rather than its popularity.

An ad populum fallacy occurs when an argument is based solely on the fact that many people agree with it, without providing any substantive evidence or logical reasoning to support the claim. It can also be a claim to certainty rather than stating something is seemingly or probably true. In the case of Proverbs 11:14, the emphasis is on the wisdom and insights that can come from a variety of advisers, which contributes to better decision-making. The underlying principle is that collective wisdom and diverse perspectives can lead to more successful outcomes.

In essence, while the proverb encourages seeking advice from many advisers, it's not suggesting that something is true or wise solely because many people agree with it. Instead, it's emphasizing the value of seeking well-informed opinions to make better decisions. It's important to distinguish between a practical recommendation for making informed choices and a fallacious appeal to popularity.
