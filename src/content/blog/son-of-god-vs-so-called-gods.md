**John 10:34:**
> Jesus answered them,
>> Has it not been written in your Law: 'I SAID, YOU ARE GODS'?

This verse is often cited in discussions about Jesus' divinity and his relationship to God the Father. The context of this passage is Jesus' response to the Jews' accusation that he was blaspheming by making himself out to be God. In his response, Jesus refers to a verse from **Psalm 82:6**, where God speaks to judges and says, "I said, 'You are gods; you are all sons of the Most High.'" This passage is using a metaphorical sense of the term "gods" to refer to human judges (and some may interpret them to be angelic beings) who hold authority under God's divine authority.

Jesus is essentially using a form of argument from the lesser to the greater. He is saying that if human judges can be referred to as "gods" in a metaphorical sense due to their role in administering justice under God's authority, then how much more appropriate is it for him, who has been sent by the Father and is the very Son of God, to be recognized as divine? Notice they were offended at what Jesus said in verse 30 about him and the Father being one. This is not merely being one in purpose, because that is not worthy of blasphemyor being stoned. Jesus' unique oneness with the Father is a higher claim than just being a "so-called god" from Psalm 82. Jesus' argument did not convince them because in verse 39, they were looking to arrest him. Why? Because ultimately he was still making a greater claim to deity than what the Psalm offered.

This verse is not meant to deny Jesus' divinity, but rather to emphasize his unique relationship with God the Father. It's important to consider the entire context of the Gospel of John and the teachings of Jesus throughout the New Testament when forming an understanding of his nature and divinity.
