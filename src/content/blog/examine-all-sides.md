> The first to plead his case seems right, Until another comes and examines him. (Proverbs 18:17)

This quote is from the book of Proverbs in the Bible and it expresses the idea that appearances can be deceiving and that it's important to consider multiple perspectives before making a judgment.The saying highlights the importance of considering all sides of a story and being open-minded, as the first person to speak or present their argument may not always be telling the whole truth or presenting the complete picture.

In general, hearing both sides of a story is important for several reasons:

- **To get a more complete picture:** By listening to both sides of a story, you can get a more complete understanding of what happened. Each side may have different perspectives, experiences, and information that can help you form a more accurate and balanced view of the situation.

- **To avoid bias:** If you only hear one side of a story, you may develop a biased or incomplete view of the situation. By hearing both sides, you can avoid this bias and make a more informed decision.

- **To be fair:** It is important to be fair and just when making decisions or judgments. By hearing both sides, you can ensure that you are considering all relevant information before making a decision.

- **To foster understanding and empathy:** When you listen to both sides of a story, you may gain a better understanding of each person's perspective and feelings. This can help you develop empathy and compassion for others, even if you don't agree with them.

- **To promote effective communication:** By listening to both sides of a story, you can promote effective communication and conflict resolution. This can help you find common ground and work towards a mutually beneficial solution.
